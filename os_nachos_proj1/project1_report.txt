The global variables of Thread1 and Thread2 in project1_output3.txt and project1_output4.txt are different when I schedule them in different orders.

Thread2 suspends Thread1 after it displays the thread information. After Thread2 finishes executing, Thread1 is resumed, and can finish executing.

The same things occur when you switch the scheduling. Thread1 suspends Thread2 after displaying the thread information. Then when Thread1 finishes executing, Thread2 will be resumed and finish executing.
